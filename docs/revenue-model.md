## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Model
```python
class PricingEngine:
    def calculate_entry_fee(self, player_tier, game_type, demand):
        base_fee = self.get_base_fee(game_type)
        tier_multiplier = self.get_tier_multiplier(player_tier)
        demand_factor = self.calculate_demand_factor(demand)
        
        return base_fee * tier_multiplier * demand_factor
    
    def get_house_edge(self, game_size, stakes):
        # Smaller games = higher house edge
        if game_size < 10:
            return 0.15  # 15%
        elif game_size < 25:
            return 0.12  # 12%
        else:
            return 0.10  # 10%
```

### 2. Player Retention System
```python
def calculate_loyalty_rewards(player_id):
    player_stats = get_player_statistics(player_id)
    games_played = player_stats['total_games']
    total_spent = player_stats['total_deposits']
    
    # Loyalty bonus based on activity
    loyalty_percentage = min(games_played * 0.001, 0.05)  # Max 5%
    bonus_amount = total_spent * loyalty_percentage
    
    return bonus_amount
```

### 3. Tournament System
```python
def create_tournament(entry_fee, max_players, prize_distribution):
    total_prize_pool = entry_fee * max_players
    house_commission = total_prize_pool * 0.20  # 20% for tournaments
    
    prize_pool = total_prize_pool - house_commission
    
    return {
        'total_collected': total_prize_pool,
        'house_revenue': house_commission,
        'player_prizes': distribute_prizes(prize_pool, prize_distribution)
    }
```

## Analytics and Optimization

### 1. Player Behavior Analytics
```python
def analyze_player_behavior():
    metrics = {
        'average_session_length': get_avg_session_time(),
        'games_per_session': get_avg_games_per_session(),
        'conversion_rate': calculate_conversion_rate(),
        'retention_rate': calculate_retention_rate(),
        'lifetime_value': calculate_player_ltv()
    }
    return metrics
```

### 2. Revenue Optimization

### 3. Financial Tracking
```python
@app.route('/api/admin/revenue', methods=['GET'])
def get_revenue_report():
    period = request.args.get('period', 'daily')
    
    revenue_data = {
        'game_commissions': calculate_game_commissions(period),
        'subscription_revenue': get_subscription_revenue(period),
        'transaction_fees': calculate_transaction_fees(period),
        'advertising_revenue': get_ad_revenue(period),
        'total_revenue': 0
    }
    
    revenue_data['total_revenue'] = sum(revenue_data.values())
    return jsonify(revenue_data)
